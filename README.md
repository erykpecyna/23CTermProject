# 23CTermProject
Term Project for Math 23C

Utilization of various statistical techniques on a dataset of Spotify music data.

FinalProject.R contains all code with comments describing the methods used while highlights.Rmd contains a shorter demonstration skipping most of the implementation details and instead demonstrates the results. A knitted version of highlights.Rmd is included as highlights.html and writeup.pdf contains a quick written summary of our work and techniques.
