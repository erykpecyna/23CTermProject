# 23CTermProject
Term Project for Math 23C

Utilization of various statistical techniques on a dataset of Spotify music data.
  
Some techniques utilized:  
-Principal Components Analysis  
-Linear Regression by Matrix Projection  
-Permutation Tests  
-Various examples of basic statistical analysis  
  
FinalProject.R contains all code with comments describing the methods used while highlights.Rmd contains a shorter demonstration skipping most of the implementation details and instead demonstrates the results. A knitted version of highlights.Rmd is included as highlights.html and writeup.pdf contains a quick written summary of our work and techniques.  
  
Notes:
Most interesting parts of FinalProject.R are lines 35-155 where functions implementing the techniques mentioned above are implemented.
